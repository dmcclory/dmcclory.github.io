<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/X1011/git-directory-deploy">git-directory-deploy</a> to write my assets to dmcclory.github.io</p>

<p>this way, I can use a different static site generator (like lineman).</p>

<p>in order to make this work, I keep all of my blog machinery in a different branch (I call it spaceship). Then I run the deploy.sh script from git-directory-deploy, which I've configured to write to master.<p>
