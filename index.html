    <p>If all goes well, I&#39;ll be reading this at dmcclory.github.io</p>

<p>I&#39;m an awesome quote</p>

<p>We&#39;re going to fill this thing up with an awful lot of content. The <em>ghoal is to have a bunch of paragraphs of text</em>, each of which can and ought to be arbitrarily long. The idea is to see what multi-line paragraphs look like, in order to get a <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html">an appropriate line spacing and line width</a>. And once we&#39;ve done that, we can focus on other things.</p>
<p><strong>Like making the page layout <em>sing.</em> </strong></p>
<p>And so let&#39;s just spitball. Let&#39;s say they hold the tryouts for PHIT house teams twice a year. The last one was in October, which was 3 months ago. So maybe they&#39;ll hold auditions again in April to June? By that time I&#39;ll have finished 301. Even if they hold them in March, I&#39;ll have finished 301. As far as I can tell, there are a number of people on teams who haven&#39;t been through all of the classes - Max, Mallory X, Scott Campbell. So having been through the classes isn&#39;t necessary condition for getting on a team. What is a necessary condition for getting on a team? that&#39;s a good question. I&#39;ll add it to the list of open questions. There was another thread, to visit. Ok, so if they hold them in April, I could definitely be in good shape. And if I don&#39;t make it, first of all, I won&#39;t die, but second of all, there&#39;ll be other opportunities and other teams to join, and probably another set of auditions at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Wierd thought: what is the rate at which teams die? When they add three teams, that&#39;ll bring the total up to 10. 2 are kinda newer. And now that I think of it, some of those other teams are only like a year or a year and a half old. And they didn&#39;t exist a few years ago. Maybe teams only last like 2 or 3 years? 3 years is a long time to be doing something. So some of the teams won&#39;t exist next year or in two years. Who will go first? Sabotage? Doctor Sleepover? Big Baby?</p>
<p>A whole &#39;nother angle is: writing scripts/sketches. I&#39;ll turn my attention to this later, but for now I think I have enough content to try out layouts with real text. Thank you brain! for having an endless amount of stuff to churn and type out!</p>
<h3 id="open-questions-">Open questions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>What is a necessary condition for getting on a house team?</li>
<li>what can I do to get better, to increase my chances of getting picked?<ul>
<li>of being so good that there&#39;s no reason to not pick me?</li>
